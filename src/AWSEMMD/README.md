This package contains a 2023 compatible LAMMPS implementation of the AWSEMMD model for protein folding and binding. The model is described in:

Aram Davtyan, Nicholas P. Schafer, Weihua Zheng, Cecilia Clementi, Peter G. Wolynes, and Garegin A. Papoian, 
"AWSEM-MD: Protein Structure Prediction Using Coarse-Grained Physical Potentials and Bioinformatically Based Local Structure Biasing", 
The Journal of Physical Chemistry B 2012 116 (29), 8494-8503
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp212541y

And is originally implemented (https://github.com/adavtyan/awsemmd) for older versions of LAMMPS.

This implementation is based on the 2023 stable version of LAMMPS, and is not guaranteed to work with other versions. It is also not guaranteed to be bug-free, and is not yet supported by the LAMMPS developers. It is provided as-is, and is intended to be used as a starting point for further development.

## Installation

To install, follow standard LAMMPS installation routines, but include AWSEMMD as a package. 

## Usage

See original AWSEMMD documentation for usage instructions.
